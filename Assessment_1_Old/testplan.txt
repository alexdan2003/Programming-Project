Testplan

To test these modules I will approach it with Implementation testing as I will be testing every part of the program during my implementation to ensure that it functions under any circumstances that I can think of.
To ensure that my implementation can function well I will be testing it using valid data, extreme data and invalid data as it will provide me with the widest amount of circumstances possible, therefore ensuring that the
code is as soundproof as it can possibly be. 

Furthermore I will also be using regression testing to ensure that the code continues to work as I add more of the implementation to it, ensuring that I do not miss any odd scenarios that can occur due to a poor implementation
of a later task. All of these tests will be written in a bash script, allowing me to easily add to the tests and easily run all tests again as I add functionality to the program.
